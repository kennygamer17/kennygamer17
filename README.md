# Hello everyone

### My name is 
## Kenneth Waldo 
### but my nickname is: Lexor_12, I am a Software Development student.

> [!NOTE]
This is my first and main Repo, in it we can find some of my projects, some of them are made in C++, but others are made in HTML,Java,etc I just want to show other people who I am when it comes to programming, I am passionate programming since I was little, my goal is to work in a large company.

For now, I just want to learn more, more, and MORE!! about programming languages.
It's probably not the best, since I'm just learning, but you learn from your mistakes hahaha.
